# neovim_config

## Prerequisite

- A terminal that supports truecolor (I use [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/))
- Configure your terminal to use a patched font from [nerdfonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)

## Setup

- Install [neovim](https://neovim.io) with your preferred package manager
- Clone this repo
- Copy the nvim folder to your `~/.config` path
- Run neovim with `nvim` in your shell.
- It will throw an error (something about rose-pine not being installed). Don't worry!
- Hit enter and wait for Packer to install all the plugins
- Close neovim
- Open it again
- The configs should now be successfully installed! Have fun!
